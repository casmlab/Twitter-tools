Instructions
------------

-- constants_example.rb --
Most of the code in this repo requires your Twitter credentials. Save constants_example.rb as constants.rb and update all the entries with your credentials.

To get OAuth credentials, you must register your application with Twitter. See http://dev.twitter.com/pages/auth#register for details.

-- get_user_ids.rb --
A short script that accepts an array of Twitter screen_names and returns a list of names and their matching Twitter user_ids as a CSV file. The Streaming API requires user_id for most functions that allow you to collect data by user, and this is the fastest way to get a list of user_ids for users you want to follow, aggregate, etc.

Dependencies:
rubygems
twitter4r
twitter

Setup:
Make sure constants.rb contains your Twitter OAuth credentials.
Put all the screen_names you want to lookup in a plain text file, one screen_name per line.

Usage:

ruby get_user_ids.rb input_file output_file

where input_file and output_file are full paths to the list of screen_names and the CSV file you want the script to create with screen_names and ids.

-----
To Do
-----
1. Allow batch lookup in get_users_ids.rb (Twitter will allow you to look up 20 at a time.)
